Open Source NYC May

## Open Source NYC May

I attended the Open Source NYC May meeting on May 4th. There were panel discussions given by people who are professional in software industry and are active in open source communities.

In the past I never linked open source software to my professional career. However, after the meeting I learned that my experience of open source software could indeed benefit me in job hunting.

I learned more about jobs offered by companies specific on open source software. Moreover, a lot of companies apply open source software to their production. Therefore, having experience in the open source software utilized by the targeting company can show one's qualification in the job.

Job hunting is complicated. I also learned what to look for when I search jobs and how to negotiate with employers.

This meeting gave me insights about the connection between open source software and my career.
