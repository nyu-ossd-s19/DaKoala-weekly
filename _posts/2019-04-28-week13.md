Summary of My Contribution to Vue.js

# Document

At the beginning of our project, both me and my teammate Jonathan had some difficulties installing the development environment. I submitted an [issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9606) but was closed by the author of Vue.js. Later when Jonathan submitted another issue to state his problems in installing development environment, another maintainer said they did not use the tool we used to install dependencies. 

In order to help beginning contributors who were not familiar with the tool they used, I sent a [pull request](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/9848) to add instruction on installing the tool.

Apart from instruction on setting development environment, I also [fixed an grammar](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/9858) error in the document.

Recently, based on an issue, I added [some tips](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/pull/2140) to the official document. When the pull request got merged, I added [its Chinese translation](https://github.com/vuejs/cn.vuejs.org/pull/910) to the Chinese document.

# Comment

I play an active roll in the community and usually communicate with other community members. I commented on [an issue related to TypeScript in Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9873#issuecomment-483387349), [an feature request](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9661#issuecomment-482172760) and tried to do [some work on an existing issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9573#issuecomment-485058632).

I provided a [workaround](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9573#issuecomment-485133528) to an existing issue and was authorized by a maintainer.

# Code-based Contribution

I finally made a code-based contribution to Vue.js. Although it was only 2 lines, it did take me great effort to figure out the mechanism of Vue.js.

Web Component is a new technique in web development and is gradually supported by more and more browsers. Currently, Vue.js will only check node tags defined in Vue components and those explicitly ignored by users.

In the [feature](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/9919) I submitted, I make Vue.js check those tags defined in Web Component.

This feature is now accepted by the maintainer of Vue.js and will be effective in the next minor version.

# What I learned

Through the contributions to Vue.js, I learned the process of contributing to a large scale open source project.

Although the contribution may be small, it takes a contributor a lot of time to figure out the mechanism of the software before make any code contribution. This can improve a contributor's skill.

An active community is the foundation of a vigorous open source software.
