Lessons in The _Cathedral and the Bazaar_

# Some Important Lessons

> Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.

Here we are talking about the perfection of a software. When there is nothing to be taken away from a software, the software is not only functional, but also clean. Every feature of the software is significant. There is no redundant feature or features that easily confuse users.

This definition of perfection reminds me a new way to judge the design of a software. People tend to judge a software by the number of features it has, but we should really take time think about features need to be removed from a software. Unnecessary features may confuse users, obscure the core function of a software. Moreover, it takes developers effort to maintain the redundant features. Removing useless features from a software can help developers and maintainers focus on the core part of the software.

> Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.

When people design software, it is not guaranteed that the design is always a perfect one, even if it is feasible. Following the imperfect design, a product may be created. However, creation of the product does not mean we must stick to it all the time. When we realize the imperfection and come up with a innovative design to solve some problems exist in the current software, just work on the new one.

I think this is a good method to produce high-quality software. Sometimes it is almost impossible for us to predict problems exist in our software design. Not until we produce a finished-product do we realize some flaws of the design. In order to have a functional software, we compromise and start using the imperfect product, at the same time we have to maintain it. However, we should pick a time to start developing a new version of the software. Maybe we have to restart, but sometimes it is worthwhile.

The software I am working on this semester is Vue.js. Its current version is 2.x. Prior to the 2.x version, it had 1.x version and 0.x version. From 0.x to 1.x and from 1.x to 2.x, the author of rewrote the whole software. However, it was rewriting that solved some serious problems in the software or introduced some breaking features. People design wrong software all the time, we do not need to compromise to the wrong design.
